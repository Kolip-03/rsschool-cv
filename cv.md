## Some information about me

My main goal is to become a **front-end developer**. It is difficult to find a more purposeful person than me. I am good at understanding any information. I am a fast learner and quickly get into the job. I have good communication skills, I can communicate with people and find a common language with them. Unfortunately, I have no work experience, but before signing up for these courses, I independently and intensively studied programming languages such as **JS** and **C++**, as well as markup languages **HTML** and **CSS**. I am sure that in the future it will help me become a good **front - end developer** and do my job perfectly.
